This project is about predicting diabetes using machine learning with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains health-related information such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, and age. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, training the SVM model, and evaluating its performance. The model helps classify whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on their medical features. With accuracy achieved on the test data, this project shows how machine learning can be applied in healthcare for early disease prediction. Future improvements can include testing other algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and building a user-friendly interface.
